# Fun with Sudoku

Playing around with ways of solving sudoku puzzles, implemented in different
languages, for fun.

## Ruby

The Ruby solver can solve the hard puzzle in 6-8 seconds on an i5 NUC.

## Go

The Go solver, which uses the same algorithm as the Ruby solver, can
solve the same hard puzzle in about 500ms on an i5 NUC.
